# Python Tutorial
Juyper Notebook based Python tutorial

## Target Audience

* Python beginners with experience in other programming languages (like Java, C++), who want to learn the specialities and features of Python.

* Python programmers with medicore experience may find some useful information in this tutorial, too.

This tutorial is not intended for:

* Beginners with no (object-oriented) programming experience - basic programming concepts are not introduced in detail, but expected from the reader.

* Python experts (obviously...)

## Structure

This tutorial is not structured linearly (from chapter 1-x), but the notebooks covering specific topics are rather independent from each other.
I tried to illustrate the various points without requiring too much knowledge of other topics, but implicit dependencies could not be avoided.

## Technology

This tutorial is written for Python 3.

The notebooks can be opened using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

It is assumed that all packages included in the Anaconda distribution are installed. If Miniconda is used, it may be required to install additional packages using

    conda install [-c conda-forge] package
